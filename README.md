# Mask detection, different experiments

## Phase One:
working with image and image processing:
* First make file class. because all images are gathered together in one file, I need to separate them into different files based on their classes 
* Class name 'Labels' is written in different XML files.  
** Second, Face extraction. For dowing more experiment, I will make two groups of images, the first one will represent the full image  "images will be kept as its". The second group will have only faces.
**  at this step, total number of files "class name" is four, first type "full_image" has two files 'classes' and the second type is face_image has tow files "classes"
* Third, to understand the effect of color, more experiments will be used, such as black and wight, 
* Finally, since the total number of images  is small, image augmentation will be used to produce more images for each class and type
